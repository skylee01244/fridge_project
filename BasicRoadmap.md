HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

Role: HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and outlining their structure.
Contribution: HTML provides the basic structure and content of your website, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and input fields.



CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

Role: CSS is used for styling HTML elements and controlling their layout on web pages.
Contribution: CSS adds visual appeal to your website by specifying things like colors, fonts, margins, padding, and positioning.



JavaScript:

Role: JavaScript is a versatile programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
Contribution: JavaScript will be essential for implementing features such as form validation, handling user input, and updating content dynamically without reloading the page.



SQL (Structured Query Language):

Role: SQL is a language used for managing and manipulating databases.
Contribution: SQL is necessary for creating and querying databases to store and retrieve user input data, such as grocery items and their expiry dates.



Python/PHP/Ruby (Choose one as your back-end language):

Role: These are server-side scripting languages used for building the back-end logic of your website.
Contribution: They handle tasks such as processing user input, interacting with the database, and generating dynamic content to be served to the user's browser.



Python Flask/Django, PHP Laravel, Ruby on Rails (Frameworks for back-end):

Role: Frameworks provide pre-built components and tools to streamline web development in their respective languages.
Contribution: Frameworks help you organize your code, handle routing, manage sessions, and interact with databases more efficiently.



JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):

Role: JSON is a lightweight data interchange format used for transmitting data between a web server and a browser.
Contribution: JSON can be used to structure and transfer data between the front-end and back-end of your website, facilitating communication between different parts of your application.
By learning and using these languages together, you'll be able to create a dynamic and interactive website that meets your requirements, from capturing user input to displaying relevant information and managing data efficiently.




learning order:
HTML -> CSS -> Javascript -> SQL -> Python/PHP/Ruby -> Python Flask/Django, PHP Larvel, Ruby on Rails -> JSON

HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

- Start with HTML as it forms the foundation of web development. Learn how to create the structure of web pages, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and input fields.
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

-   Once you're comfortable with HTML, move on to CSS to learn how to style your web pages. Understand concepts like selecting elements, applying styles, and managing  layouts.


JavaScript:

- Next, dive into JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to your web pages. Learn about variables, functions, control structures, DOM manipulation, and event handling.


SQL (Structured Query Language):

- After gaining proficiency in front-end development, start learning SQL to understand how to create and manipulate databases. Learn about database design, querying data, and managing database operations.


Python/PHP/Ruby (Choose one as your back-end language):

- Once you have a grasp of front-end technologies and databases, choose a back-end language to learn. Focus on understanding the syntax, data types, control structures, and built-in functions of the chosen language.


Python Flask/Django, PHP Laravel, Ruby on Rails (Frameworks for back-end):

- Once you're comfortable with the back-end language, explore frameworks that streamline web development in your chosen language. Learn how to use the framework's features to build web applications more efficiently.


JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):

- Finally, learn about JSON as a data interchange format to facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end of your website. Understand how to serialize and deserialize JSON data and integrate it into your web application.
By following this order, you'll build a strong foundation in web development and gradually progress from creating static web pages to building dynamic web applications with a back-end server and database integration.
